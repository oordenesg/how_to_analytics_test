## Theory

On-Demand economy is defined as the economic activity created by tech companies. Some apps use different platforms that connects people or drives. To pass the test it is important to understand the business. Let's, imagine that we are analyzing data from a random driver app. In this ecosystem we have different actors, one of them is the drivers.

Riders: They see the availability of rides and the price. After this they can then choose to request a rider. The app will calculate the fare based on time and distance.  

In this app usually fares are 80% to drives and 20% to the company. Payment is secure since riders pay only via credit card. Considering this we can say that:
**Demand** = **Riders** or **Passengers**
**Supply** = **Drivers** or **Driver Partners** 

Some Basics Metrics

**App Openings (Eyeballs)** = Customers who lauch the app looking for a riders. It is a good measure of demand

**Zeroes** = Customers who open the app and see no cars in the area.
**Requets** = Customers who make requets for a car.
**Completed Trip** = The point fromwhen a customer is picked
**Completion Ride** = The percentage of requets to the completed trips.
**Peak hours** = Rush hours when demand is high.
